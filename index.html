                <p class="text-gray">In 1964, at the instance and initiative of Late Ranadeb Chaudhuri and with active co-operation of some eminent educationist and persons of public spirit, who formed the first Governing Body of this college, two commodious building on the main thoroughfare of Prince Anwar Shah Road were acquired to house the college. The buildings were remodelled to suit the purposes of a modern college with all possible amenities for students and teachers. The college started functioning from June 1965 as a co-educational institution. The aim of this college was to provide higher education to people from the lowest economic strata of Society and this mission is still being pursued earnestly. </p>
